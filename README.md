Remember to backup your files. Never run this against the database of an active GeniSys installation. I cannot be help responsible for any damage you do to
your dynalite system or the hourly rates some local company will charge you if they have to drive allllll the way from their office to fix the out-of-service windows7 machine running
the free version of team-viewer as the perfect compliment to the vb6 application which will randomly decide it doesn't want to accept the serial key you paid thousands of dollars for.

Just sayin.

^But you aren't allowed any Dynet/Dynalite reference or training material. Infact just for asking that, Philips nuked any of the remaining public support portals for Dynalite and asked your friendly national experts to never respond to a single email about anything.
